Conclusion
choosing a proper data structure is not an easy task
linear data structure
nonlinear data structure

Classification
linear data structure
each element can be logically adjacent to the following or the previous element
non-linear data structure
a single element can be logically adjacent to numerous others, not necessarily only one or two

Arrays
store many data of the same type
random access data structures
single-dimensional, multi-dimensional, and jagged arrays (array of arrays)
names of months, the multiplication table, or even a map of a game
selection sort, insertion sort, bubble sort, merge sort, Shell sort, quicksort, and heap sort

Lists
dynamically increase the size of the collection
ArrayList, generic (List) and sorted (SortedList) variants
singly linked list, a doubly linked list, a circular singly linked list, and a circular doubly linked list
doubly linked list (LinkedList)
database of people, address book, read the book, spins the wheel

Stacks

push
pop

Queues
enqueue
dequeue

Dictionaries
mapping keys to values and performing fast lookups
non-generic (Hashtable) and generic (Dictionary)
associative arrays, database indices, or cache systems

Sets
collection of distinct objects without duplicated elements and without any particular order
union, intersection, subtraction, and symmetric difference
HashSet class
